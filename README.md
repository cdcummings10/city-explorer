## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1) Obtain JSON files or database/APIs needed for grabbing data.
2) Create backend with express, cors, and dotenv.
3) Create get functions for different categories (i.e. weather, location, etc.)
4) Create constructor functions to normalize data.
5) Return data based on correct inputs.

## Architecture

    Google Maps
